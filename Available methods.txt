When using the methods you should have set loopAmount to 1900 like:
loopAmount=1900 in .sh (our config) file.

When you use cpu-burner1 the loopAmount should be very high like 10000.
When you use yooniksbypass2 and yooniksbypass it should be low like from 500 to 1900.

You have to always use fresh socks.txt file (it really matters, otherwise the power can be weak because of slow crash connections)
The current socks.txt file is from 21.01.2020 22:03 CEST timezone (very fresh).
